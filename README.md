# Ration-Distribution
Ration Distribution system 
The public distribution system (PDS) for food supply is often plagued by fraud and corruption,
preventing essential resources from reaching the intended beneficiaries, particularly the poor
and marginalized. To address these issues, this project proposes a blockchain-based prototype
aimed at securing and streamlining the food supply chain. This web-based application will
record all transactions and activities within the PDS, involving stakeholders such as the central
government, state governments, district offices, ration shops, and end consumers.
